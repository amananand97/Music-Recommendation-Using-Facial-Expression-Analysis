# Music-Recommendation-Using-Facial-Expression-Analysis

This Computer Vision project, developed as part of my master's degree, demonstrates my expertise in transfer learning and content-based learning. It focuses on real-time analysis of facial expressions to accurately predict the current state of emotion. Leveraging deep learning techniques, specifically the VGG16 model, the project involves training a robust emotion recognition system. It utilizes a dataset of labeled facial images and employs techniques such as data augmentation, model fine-tuning, and evaluation metrics to achieve high accuracy in emotion classification. Additionally, the project incorporates machine learning algorithms to predict suitable songs based on the detected emotion, enhancing the user experience. Throughout the project, I demonstrated proficiency in Python, TensorFlow, Keras, OpenCV, and various data preprocessing techniques.
